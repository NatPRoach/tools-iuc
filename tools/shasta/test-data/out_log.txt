Shasta Release 0.6.0 for MacOS-10.15 & MacOS-10.14
2020-Nov-10 15:51:27.362737 
To run an assembly, use the "--input" option to specify the input files. Use the "--help" option for a description of the other options and parameters.

Default values of assembly parameters are not recommended for any specific application and mostly reflect approximate compatibility with previous releases.See the shasta/conf or shasta-install/conf directory for sample configuration files containing assembly parameters for specific applications.

For more information about the Shasta assembler, see
https://github.com/chanzuckerberg/shasta

Complete documentation for the latest version of Shasta is available here:
